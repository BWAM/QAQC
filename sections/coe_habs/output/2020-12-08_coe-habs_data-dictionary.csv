column_name,definition
sys_sample_code,Sample ID
sample_date,Date the sample was collected
site,"The site name identifies the field site name (control, esf, or clarkson) or will be 'lab' for lab generated samples"
location,"The location at the site that the sample was collected (ambient, influent, or effluent) or will be 'lab' for lab generated samples"
lab_sdg,Sample Delivery Group (SDG) is assigned to batches of data provided by ALS. This can be useful for tracking down associated lab reports.
sample_source,Idenifies if the sample was collected in the field (FIELD) or part of a lab test (LAB). Assigned by ALS.
nysdec_sample_type,"The type of sample represented. Most users will only be interested in the 'standard_sample's, the target samples. The remaining types correspond to different QC samples."
chemical_name,The parameter measured
fraction,Indicates if the measured parameter is dissolved or total.
result_value,Measured parameter value.
result_unit,Measured parameter values units.
lab_flag,Interpreted flags provided by ALS.
lab_anl_method_name,Lab analytical method
cas_rn,CAS Registry Number for the parameter measured. Assigned by ALS.
method_detection_limit,The method detecion limit.
detection_limit_unit,Units for the method_detectiom_limit.
quantitation_limit,The quantiation limit.
analysis_date,Date the sample was analyzed by ALS.
equipment_blank_ssc,The sys_sample_code(s) of the equipment blank sample.
equipment_blank,A flag or flags for the equipment blank QC test.
equipment_blank_result_value,The equipment blank value(s) associated with the equipment_blank_ssc(s) and equipment_blank flag(s).
precision_ssc,A flag(s) for the precision QC test.
precision,A flag or flags for the precision QC test.
precision_result_value,The relative percent difference (RPD) values associated with precision_ssc and precision_result_value
accuracy_ssc,A flag(s) for the accuracy QC test.
accuracy,A flag or flags for the accuracy QC test. These tests were performed by ALS.
accuracy_result_value,The result values associated with accuracy_ssc and accuracy_result_value
qc,"Summarizes the results from 'equipment_blank', 'accuracy', and 'precision.' If one or more of these values was 'fail', then the value will be 'reject'. If none of the values contained `fail`, then 'accept' was returned. All data labled as 'reject' should be excluded from analyses."
